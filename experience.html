        <p id="introText">I worked nearly my whole adult life at GameStop, the
            leading retailer of videogame and pop culture merchandise. Starting
            just before the end of highschool, I covered a wide range of roles
            with the company, and each step taught me new skills and fresh
            perspectives that will benefit any work place.</p>

                        Solid communication is the backbone of an efficient work
